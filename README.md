I am a **Research Scientist** at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). My research investigates and interrogates the ways that computing and sociotechnical systems impact and interact with people and communities. I use human-centered, community-oriented, and participatory approaches to research and design computing systems and environments for social good+justice, education, and community empowerment, including learning environments that interrogate the intersections of computing ethics, data, AI literacy, community values and identity, art, and justice-centered computing. Among others, my projects include â€” the development of creative technologies for teaching computing and AI through [dance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3635636.3656206), [art](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632621.3671422), and [game design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3502717.3532137); curricular design for computer science, [tech ethics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569753), data, and [AI literacy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632621.3671422); electronics, wearables, and tangible design interfaces for [interactive computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3633350) and [art making](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3568813.3600132); and data analytics for supporting programming and AI education. I was awarded a Computing Innovation Fellowship by the Computing Research Association and hold a PhD in Computer Science from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). I was recently awarded a US National Science Foundation grant for developing [scalable computing ethics education tools and curricula for ethics and responsible computing education](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569753).
